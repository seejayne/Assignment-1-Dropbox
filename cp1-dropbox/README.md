## Dropbox

This is a prototype of Dropbox! It lets you navigate through some scenes and some tabs and scroll. Fun stuff!

I am still trying to get the welcome screens to scroll properly. Vertical scrolling seems to work just fine, not sure why left to right scrolling doesn't work. Also looking into just using a Page View Controller instead. 

####How many hours did it take to complete?
6 hours to get the basic functionality. Additional 3 for playing with optional things. Took a while to fix the scrollview. Lots of things to check and uncheck in the various properties!

####Which required and optional stories have you completed?
- Completed all the required stories
- Optional: Added swipe recognziers on the welcome screen, but for some reason it is only working on the first one
- Optional: Added the text field with the real keyboard for the sign up screen so you can actually type 

####GIF walkthrough of all required and optional stories
